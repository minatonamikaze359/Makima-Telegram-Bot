Makima Bot â€” Expanded package
==================================
What is included:
- bot.py (Telegram polling bot implementing many menu commands as placeholders)
- admin_dashboard/ (Flask app to view users and approve WhatsApp proofs)
- requirements.txt
- README.md
- LICENSE (MIT)

Quick run (local):
1. Install Python 3.10+
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Edit bot.py: set ADMIN_IDS list to your admin numeric Telegram IDs.
4. Run the bot: python bot.py
5. In another terminal, run admin dashboard: python admin_dashboard/app.py
   Open http://localhost:5001 to view users and proofs.

Notes:
- This expanded package implements many commands as safe placeholders. Integrating real downloaders, AI, or NSFW content requires APIs and compliance.
- For Katabump deployment, ensure persistent process support and expose the admin dashboard port if needed.
